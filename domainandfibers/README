(1) 4 Laplace Equations are first solved here with different types of Dirichlet boundary conditions

    Case 1: phi_AB (apico-basal)
        Base: 1.0
        Epi (apex): 0.0

    Case 2: phi_LV (LV endocardium)
        Endo (LV) : 1.0
        Epi, Endo (RV) : 0.0

    Case 3: phi_RV (RV endocardium)
        Endo (RV) : 1.0
        Epi, Endo (LV) : 0.0

    Case 4: phi_EPI (epicardium)
        Epi : 1.0
        Endo (LV, RV) : 0.0

(2) Results from the above 4 simulations (.vtu files) are used to solve for myocardium layers

(3) Gradients evaluated in step (2) are used to determine myocardium fibers
